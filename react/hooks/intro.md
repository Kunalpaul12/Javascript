# Hooks introduce in React 16.8 to use React feature in function component in react native it was introduce in 0.59

## Why Hooks

We already have a class that works well then why hooks ....?

- React does not offer a way to attached reusable logic to component thus for this purpose we use pattern such as render props and HOC (higher order component) 

- Class does not minify very well and thus they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable 

- For most of the newer developer the concept of classes such as bind and this is very hard to understand
